# DriverDrowsinessDetection
This Python-based project detects driver drowsiness in real time using a webcam. It leverages MediaPipe to track facial landmarks and calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). When the driverâ€™s eyes remain closed for more than 3 seconds, the system plays an alarm sound using Pygame and logs the incident with the date and time.
